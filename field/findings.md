# Field findings — parkmitra

Mandatory finding format. Blocks are appended the day they happen; nothing here is
reconstructed after the fact. Every `Actual` block is terminal output pasted verbatim.

Issues are filed at `niha-and-co/ai-platform` with labels `niha-cli,finding,challenge-q3`.

### F-05  User-scope personal skills from another tool's home directory are listed under a heading called "Team skills"
Severity:    S3
Area:        interactive session — /help, skill discovery
Scenario:    none
Frequency:   every time (2/2, once by hand and once in a clean scripted session)
Environment: macOS 26.2 (Darwin 25.2.0), VS Code integrated terminal, zsh, niha v1.3.7
Phase:       0, set up
Steps:
  1. Have at least one skill in ~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md (Claude Code's user skills directory)
  2. cd into any project and run: niha
  3. /help
Expected:    a skill loaded from the current user's own machine is presented as personal and local, not under a team/org heading.
Actual:
  $ niha
  $ /help
  ...
    Team skills
      /business-site — Generate a complete local-business website ... [personal skill]
      /car-rental-site — Generate a complete, ready-to-pitch car rental website ... [personal skill]
  Type / to see all commands
Impact:      No time lost, but the label is contradictory on its own line: the item is
             tagged "[personal skill]" while sitting under "Team skills". For a
             governance product this matters more than cosmetics — skill origin is a
             trust boundary in the code itself (`skillSearchRoots` assigns
             org:"approved", project:"local", user:"local"), and the display collapses
             that distinction. A reader can reasonably conclude either that the org
             approved this skill, or that their private skill is visible to their team.
             Neither is true.
Suggested:   Title the category by origin rather than a single fixed string — "Team
             skills" only for org-scope (trust: approved), and "Personal skills" /
             "Project skills" for user- and project-scope. `ORIGIN_LABEL` already holds
             the right words; the heading just does not use them.
Disposition: FILED (#1015)

Tier: T3 — cosmetic, recorded not fixed.

Context, deliberately recorded so this is not mistaken for a security claim: niha reads
`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/commands`, `<project>/.claude/skills` and
`<project>/.claude/commands` by design — they are listed explicitly in
`skillSearchRoots()`, alongside its own `.niha` paths. That is intentional interop with
Claude Code, not an exfiltration path, and `.claude` is also in niha's `PROTECTED_DIRS`
so it guards the directory rather than modifying it. The finding here is the labelling
only. Worth noting separately that the setup guide does not mention this ingestion at
all, so a user will not expect another tool's personal skills to become invokable niha
commands whose content reaches the model when run — a documentation gap rather than a
defect.

### F-06  `niha whoami --json` prints human-formatted text, so the example in its own `--help` fails
Severity:    S2
Area:        CLI — whoami, `--json` / non-interactive output
Scenario:    none
Frequency:   every time (4/4)
Environment: macOS 26.2 (Darwin 25.2.0), VS Code integrated terminal, zsh, niha v1.3.7
Phase:       0, set up
Steps:
  1. niha whoami --help          # read the documented flag and its example
  2. niha whoami --json | jq     # run that example verbatim
Expected:    machine-readable JSON on stdout, as `--help` states: "--json  Output as JSON (machine-readable)", with the worked example "niha whoami --json | jq".
Actual:
  $ niha whoami --help
  Usage: niha whoami [options]

  Show current identity and trust level

  Options:
    --json      Output as JSON (machine-readable)
    -h, --help  display help for command

  Examples:
    niha whoami              Show your user, org, role, and trust level
    niha whoami --json | jq  Machine-readable output for scripts

  $ niha whoami --json | jq
  jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 2, column 7

  $ niha whoami --json
    Auth:      JWT token
    Name:      amrutha.korumilli
    Email:     amrutha.korumilli@techatcore.com
    Org:       AI Challenge Q3 2026
    Role:      capability_builder
    Trust:     L1
    Token:     valid for 29d 23h
    Profile:   niha
    Store:     keychain "niha" (falls back to /Users/amruthakorumilli/.niha/credentials.json)

    ✓ Verified against https://api.nihaandco.com/api/v1/auth/me
Impact:      Any script or CI step that follows the documented example breaks, and it
             breaks quietly: niha exits 0, so the caller believes the command succeeded
             and only the downstream parser fails. ~10 minutes to establish that the flag
             is recognised rather than mistyped. This is not loose flag parsing — unknown
             flags are correctly rejected (`niha whoami --banana` → "error: unknown option
             '--banana'", exit 1), so `--json` is specifically registered, documented,
             given a worked example, and then ignored.
Suggested:   Implement `--json` for whoami to emit the same fields as a JSON object, or,
             if it is not going to be implemented, remove the flag and its example from
             `--help` so the documentation stops promising it. Separately, `niha doctor
             --json` is accepted and ignored while `--json` is not in doctor's documented
             options at all — it should either be implemented there or rejected like any
             other unknown option.
Disposition: FILED (#1016)

Tier: T2 — a workaround exists (parse the text, or use the platform API directly), so
recorded and characterised rather than fixed mid-build.

## Withdrawn

F-01 (#1012) and F-04 (#1014) are closed, and F-02 (#1010) and F-03 (#1013) are
de-scoped from the challenge. F-01's advice is defensible general product behaviour;
F-04 could not be separated from F-03 while the model was down; F-02 is `src/web`, not
the CLI; F-03 is an org credit/billing outage the team already knew about, not a defect
I found. Only findings I can defend on their own evidence are counted above.
